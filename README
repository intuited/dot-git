This branch of the dot-git repository provides functionality for
compression and decompression of OpenOffice.org files.

To activate its transparent smudge/clean filters,
add lines like the following to the working tree's `.gitattributes` file:

    *.odt filter=opendocument
    *.ods filter=opendocument
    *.odp filter=opendocument
