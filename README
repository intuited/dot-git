This branch of the dot-git repository provides functionality for
compression and decompression of OpenOffice.org files
and also for diffing arbitrary OpenDocument Format files
using the Python script `odfit`_.

The file info/attributes enables smudge/clean filters
for OpenDocument text, spreadsheet, and presentation file types.
It also enables diffing of all ODF files using ``odfit``.

``odfit`` is kind of slow, relatively, so expect delays when doing diffs.

Note that ``odfit`` is included as a git submodule.
This means that if you didn't pass the ``--recursive`` option to ``git clone``,
you will have to run ``git submodule update --init``
to initialize the ``odfit`` sub-repository.

``odfit`` requires Python in order to work.
It's only been tested with Python 2.6.
However, since recent (>= 3.1) version of OpenOffice
include or require Python 2.6, this shouldn't be a problem.
